### Project Overview: SQL Analysis of fooddelivery Orders

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of fooddelivery using SQL. The dataset includes various demographic and geographic details of customers, as well as their feedback on the orders.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (onlinefoods.csv) contains the following columns:
- *Age*: Age of the customer
- *Gender*: Gender of the customer
- *Marital Status*: Marital status of the customer
- *Occupation*: Occupation of the customer

- *Educational Qualifications*: Educational qualifications of the customer
- *Family size*: Size of the customer's family
- *latitude*: Latitude coordinate of the customer's location
- *longitude*: Longitude coordinate of the customer's location
- *Pin code*: Postal code of the customer's location
- *Output*: Whether the order was successful
- *Feedback*: Customer feedback on the order
- *Unnamed: 12*: This seems to be an additional column without a proper header, possibly redundant.

## Project Objectives
1. *Analyze customer demographics*:
   - Age distribution
   - Gender distribution
   - Marital status distribution
   - Occupation and income levels
   - Educational qualifications
   - Family size distribution

2. *Geographic analysis*:
   - Mapping customer locations based on latitude and longitude
   - Analyzing the distribution of customers across different pin codes

3. *Order Analysis*:
   - Success rate of orders
   - Customer feedback distribution (positive vs. negative)

4. *Correlation Analysis*:
   - Correlation between demographic factors and order success
   - Correlation between geographic factors and customer feedback

## Results
The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior, geographic distribution, and factors influencing order success and feedback. These insights can help in optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency.
